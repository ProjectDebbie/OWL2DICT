# OWL2DICT

Web Ontology Language (OWL) files are a popular format for ontologies. OWL format contains reasoning and quantified relationships. Tools, such as OWLREADY and OWLREADY2 can be used for OWL ontology exploration and modification. 

For annotation tasks, and especially when using GATE, it is often necessary to convert ontologies to dictionaries. By default, when converting OWL files to dictionaries (for example: using Protege), the term's immediate parent class or the top superclass are automatically used as labels. However, in reality, and espeicially in complex ontologies with many levels, the user may want to use other higher level superclasses as labels.

The aim of OWL2DICT is to enable users to create a dictionary from owl files. The user can choose classes he would like as labels, and the tool will collect all children of this class as terms.    

The input of this tool is a list containing the desired labels (classes) in a designated file. OWL2DICT maps out the entire OWL file to retrieve all the child terms for the provided classes. OWL2DICT also retrieves any associated synonyms and/or properties for retrieved child terms.

In case a class of interest (ie a label) is within a different class of interest, OWL2DICT will label a term with its nearest parent. 


The output of OWL2DICT is a dictionary object in .txt file format.
